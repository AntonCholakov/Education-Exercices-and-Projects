			<h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
		
			<ol>
			
				<li><a href="ex1.html" target="_blank">Write an if statement that examines two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex2.html" target="_blank">Write a script that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a sequence of if statements.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex3.html" target="_blank">Write a script that finds the biggest of three integers using nested if statements.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex4.html" target="_blank">Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested if statements.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex5.html" target="_blank">Write script that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a switch statement.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex6.html" target="_blank">Write a script that finds the real roots of a quadratic equation if you're given the coefficients a, b and c</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex7.html" target="_blank">Write a script that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex8.html" target="_blank">We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a script that checks if the sum of some subset of them is 0. Example: 3, -2, 1, 1, 8 -> 1+1-2=0.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex9.html" target="_blank">Write a script that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiplies it by 100; if it is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the script must report an error.</a></li>
				<li><a href="ex10.html" target="_blank">Write a script that converts a number in the range [0...999] to a text corresponding to its English pronunciation. Examples:<br>
														0 -> "Zero"<br>
														273 -> "Two hundred seventy three"<br>
														400 -> "Four hundred"<br>
														501 -> "Five hundred and one"<br>
														711 -> "Seven hundred and eleven"
